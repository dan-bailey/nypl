Playing with the NYPL API.

# end result
I didn't find a great deal of inspiration in the NYPL API, surprisingly, but I was inspired to alter my route and build a weather conditions single-page that piggybacked off the geolocation API.  This is going to be fun as hell to put together.

# focus
In the interest of making this more fun and less of a nightmare for me, I'm opting to focus on imagery of the four cities the company exists in -- NYC, London, Sydney, and Indianapolis.
