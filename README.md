# nypl
Initially I was going to do something with the NYPL Digital Collection API.  I didn't find anything inspiring in it -- odd, given my love of books.  Anyway, I then had an interesting idea for stuff to do with the weather.gov API, which was far more interesting.

# where I went wrong/what to fix
* I don't know why, but I should have declared a class of City...
* I should have uncoupled the "find the observation station" from "get the observations"...

# end result
I didn't find a great deal of inspiration in the NYPL API, surprisingly, but I was inspired to alter my route and build a weather conditions single-page that piggybacked off the geolocation API.  This is going to be fun as hell to put together.

# future updates
* Getting the city-specific imagery updated.
